/// @brief Generic template to iterate inner contour of a 2D image
/// @details Several applications across the synthesis require estimation of
/// some statistics along the inner contour around the peak in a 2D image.
/// This generic template acts as an iterator over the points of the given contour
/// enclosing the peak. Each value point referenced by this iterator is an IPosition of
/// a contour point. The points may appear at an arbitrary order, so some kind of sorting
/// is necessary if one wants to join the nearest neighbours. The contour is defined by
/// a predicate (template argument). It is a locus of points where the predicate becomes true,
/// which is closest to the maximum. The predicate can be an arbitrary type with the operator()
/// defined, which receives the value of the array and returns true or false. This class
/// is generic enough to be moved to an upper level (e.g. at least to Base, but may be even
/// to casacore). If it is ever going to become a part of casacore, it would be good to
/// generalize the class to be able to get several contours at once. In this case
/// iterator can return IPosition and the contour index.
