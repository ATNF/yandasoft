/// @mainpage ASKAP synthesis package
///
/// @section synth_intro Introduction
/// The synthesis package supports processing of radio synthesis observations,
/// including calibration, editing, and imaging. The emphasis is on the
/// processing of ASKAP and KAT scale data sets i.e. TBs per hour.
///
/// @section synth_assumptions Assumptions and goals
///
/// The large data volumes to be processed require that I/O of data be
/// minimized. Hence the goal is to write algorithms that require only
/// a minimal number of reads and writes. For spectral line processing,
/// our goal is to read the visibility data only once.
///
/// The synthesis package itself is designed to run in one process. 
/// We envisage that OpenMP-type multi-threading may be supported by
/// specialised versions of some of the classes in this package. 
/// Message passing parallel execution is supported in the 
/// @ref parallel classes and in the calim package.
///
/// We assume that the problem can be (and is) partitioned such that the
/// image data always fits in memory during the processing.
///
/// @section synth_dependencies Dependencies
/// The synthesis package makes extensive use of the ASKAP @ref fitting 
/// framework. 
///
/// Data access is via a set of classes that make use of the casa measures
/// package. Numerical data are held in casa Arrays (including Vector,
/// Matrix, and Cube). Non-numerical data are usually held in standard
/// containers such as vectors, and maps.
///
/// @section synth_status Current status of the code
///
/// @subsection synth_measurementequation 1. Measurement Equation
/// @li The subpackage contains calibration and imaging framework (equations which can be solved with the solver from the fitting package)
/// @li Class diagram could still be a bit untidy mainly because of an early decision to apply the equation to the
///whole iterator, rather than a single iteration (accessor). Imaging code requires conversion to
///use MultiChunkEquation instead of doing this iteration within each class. Then the code using measurementequation can be
///converted to call calcEquations and predict methods for an accessor, rather than iterator.
/// @li It may be tricky to implement situations where domain and range are different for calibration equation.
///For example, the case with the beamformer where one tries to calibrate LNA gains, which are
///contributing to the measured visibilities indirectly after some transform. Probably a specialization of the
///CalibrationME template is the way to go. 
///
/// @subsection synth_gridding 2. Gridding
/// @li The subpackage contains classes performing gridding and degridding operations using various kernels
/// @li It currently works only for MFS and polarization I. The addition of both should be straightforward.
/// @li The class GridKernel is a bare bones gridder/degridder. This should be adapted for various
/// architectures such as Cell or multicore.
/// @li There is some duplicated code in the VisGridder classes, especially in dealing with the 
/// calculation of convolution functions for W projection and antenna primary beam. Fairly straightforward
/// refactoring will be helpful.
/// @li Different primary beams per feed are yet to be included.
/// 
/// @subsection synth_parallel 3. Parallel application support
/// @li The subpackage is intended to parallelise measurement equation
/// @li It uses a simpler version of Ger's Master/Worker framework. It is largely complete and
/// has not been changed much recently. 
///
/// @subsection synth_simulate 4. Data simulation
/// @li The Simulator class is a port of the CASA simulator code to askap. It has similar but not
/// identical functionality. It is used by the csimulator app.
