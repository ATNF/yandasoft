Aknowledgement
--------------
Please consider acknowledging the authors of Yanda in your research paper if you have benefited
from the extensive work that has gone into creating this complex radio astronomy software
package. 

Yanda is a product of Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) 
Space and Astronomy research into highly parallel high performance computing (HPC) radio astronomy 
data reduction for the Australian Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Pathfinder (ASKAP) project. 

If you are using ASKAP data from the CSIRO Astronomy Science Data Archive (CASDA) or other repositories
then it is likely to have been produced by Yanda on the HPC facilities of the Pawsey Super Computing
Centre, Perth Western Australia. Pawsey is a partner with CSIRO in the success of the ASKAP project
and any resulting science outputs from ASKAP.
